# Graduate Extension: Colloquial Expression Handling

Extending the toy CFG-based grammar checker to detect colloquial expressions would require shifting from a purely syntactic approach to one that integrates **lexical and sociolinguistic knowledge**. Unlike grammatical errors, colloquialisms are not necessarily ungrammatical, but they may deviate from standard or academic registers depending on the writer’s background. The key adaptation would be to enrich the pipeline with a **lexicon of regionally marked words/phrases** (e.g., “gonna,” “y’all,” “innit”) and a classifier that can detect their occurrence alongside POS parsing. This could be implemented as an additional module that flags tokens or n-grams from curated colloquial dictionaries.

Some components of the existing design remain the same. The **POS-based CFG parsing** would still be useful to determine grammaticality, and the overall workflow (input TSV → parse → prediction) would continue unchanged. What changes is the addition of a **parallel lexical check**: after parsing, the system would scan for colloquial items and label them accordingly. This allows the grammar checker to stay lightweight while adding a complementary sociolinguistic dimension.

To achieve this, additional resources are needed. One would need access to **corpora of spoken and regional English** (e.g., British National Corpus spoken data, Corpus of Contemporary American English) and possibly **dialect dictionaries**. Annotated learner corpora that include colloquial expressions could also help train a classifier to distinguish colloquial vs. formal registers. In practice, the CFG module and colloquial detector could be combined so the system outputs both a grammaticality flag and a “register awareness” flag. This would extend the checker’s usefulness to contexts like academic writing support, where both grammar and formality matter.
